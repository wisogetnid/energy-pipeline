# Inconsistencies and Suggested Improvements

## Code Duplication

There may be opportunities to reduce code duplication in the data visualization scripts. For example, the `visualize-all` command in the `justfile` suggests that similar processing steps are applied to multiple files.

**Suggested Task:**

-   **Refactor Visualization Code:** Create a reusable function that encapsulates the common data loading, processing, and visualization logic. This function can then be called with different data files as input.

## Testing

The project has a good test structure, with separate test modules for data processing and data retrieval. However, the overall test coverage is unknown.

**Suggested Tasks:**

1.  **Measure Test Coverage:** Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure the test coverage of the project. The `test-coverage` command is already available in the `justfile`.
2.  **Increase Test Coverage:** Based on the coverage report, identify areas with low test coverage and add new tests to improve it.
