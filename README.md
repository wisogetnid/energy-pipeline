# Glowmarkt API dabbling

The Hildebrand Glowmarkt API (should) allows people to retrieve their energy data over an API.

## Tools
- [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) scripts to manually explore the API
- python env setup, as suggested in a post on [staticnet.io](https://staticnet.io/macos-python-dev-env/)
    - use asdf for python version management. Install it, then execute `asdf install` on the root folder (using .tool-versions)
    - use python virtual environments for local dependency management
        - use `source .venv/bin/activate` to start and `deactivate` to stop
        - install all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - run tests with `pytest`

## Todos
- use just
- actually write the code =o)
